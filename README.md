# User-Creator-Script

Short script for generating text used in creating user accounts. Creates also a shareable link in Bitwarden from the CLI

# Why?

Biggest pain point was generating 3 sets of passwords to be shared separately, this way, all the information is generated at one point in time and can be shared with the responsbile people using proper 2FA methods.
